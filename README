quickTray
----------
quickTray is a program written for Windows in Python that creates a system tray icon providing quick access to
shortcuts which you can define in the 'shortcuts' file.

Using quickTray
----------------
The configuration syntax is as follows:
	- Name of shortcut,command|parameter|parameter
Example:
	- Users directory,explorer|C:\Users

To launch quickTray, simply double click the `quickTray.py` file in Explorer and Python will execute it.  There will
	be a console window that launches with it this way.
You can also compile a `quickTray.exe` file with py2exe using the included `setup.py` file. There will not be any
	console window when launched as a .exe file.

Files in this project
----------------------
quickTray.py
	- The main source file for quickTray.
setup.py
	- A setup script for compiling this project with py2exe.
README
	- This readme file.
shortcuts
	- The configuration file for quickTray. This is needed for it to function.
shortcut-icon.ico
	- The icon file to be displayed in the system tray. You may replace this with whatever icon you'd like, but it
	must retain the 'shortcut-icon.ico' filename, and it must stay in the same directory as quickTray.

Required libraries
-------------------
To use quickTray you will need to have Python and PyWin32 installed. PyWin32 can be found here:
	- http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/
If you would like to compile a standalone executable version, you must also install py2exe, found here:
	- http://www.py2exe.org/
Note that if you wish to use py2exe with the included setup.py file, you will have to be using the 32-bit versions
	of Python and its libraries (even if you are on a 64-bit OS). This is due to the packaging options I have set
	in the setup.py file, as they are not yet supported with the 64-bit version of Python.

Compiling a standalone exe
---------------------------
To compile a standalone executable version of quickTray, simply run this command:
	- python setup.py py2exe
The resulting quickTray.exe file may be used on systems that do not have Python installed. Just be sure to keep the
	`shortcuts` and `shortcut-icon.ico` files with it.
