quickTray
----------
quickTray is a cross-platform program written in Python that creates a system tray icon providing quick access to shortcuts which you can define in the 'shortcuts' file.

Using quickTray
----------------
The configuration syntax is as follows:
	- Name of shortcut,command|parameter|parameter
Example:
	- Users directory,explorer|C:\Users

To launch quickTray, simply double click the `quickTray.py` file in Explorer and Python will execute it.  There will be a console window that launches with it this way.
You can also compile a `quickTray.exe`  file for Windows with py2exe using the included `setup.py` file. There will not be any console window when launched as a .exe file.

Files in this project
----------------------
quickTray.py
	- The main source file for quickTray.
setup.py
	- A setup script for compiling this project with py2exe.
README
	- This readme file.
shortcuts
	- The configuration file for quickTray. This is needed for it to function.
shortcut-icon.png
	- The icon file to be displayed in the system tray. You may replace this with whatever icon you'd like, but it must retain the 'shortcut-icon.png' filename, and it must stay in the same directory as quickTray.

Required libraries
-------------------
To use quickTray you will need to have Python and PyQt installed. PyQt can be found here:
	- http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/intro
If you would like to compile a standalone executable version, you must be using Windows and install py2exe, found here:
	- http://www.py2exe.org/

Compiling a standalone exe [Windows Required]
----------------------------------------------
To compile a standalone executable version of quickTray, simply run this command:
	- python setup.py py2exe
The resulting quickTray.exe file may be used on systems that do not have Python installed. Just be sure to keep the surrounding files with it and also add `shortcuts` and `shortcut-icon.png` files with it.  You may remove the w9xpopen.exe file.  Also note that the user must have the "Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Runtime Components" installed, which can be found here:

Note: It is not reccomended to use the "Bundle Files" option on py2exe on this project, as it causes memory usage to spike from ~6mb to ~32+mb.
